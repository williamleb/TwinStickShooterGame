# Twin Stick Shooter Game

This is the first game I made using the C++ programming language. 

In this game, you play as a character from a top down perspective. You must survive a never ending wave of zombies by collecting and using your different weapons.

## Additional info

The comments in the code are in French. This is because this game was made in the context of a game development class which required the French language to be used in comments.
